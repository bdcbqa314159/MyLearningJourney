In this repository, I will put all work in the areas of interest.
I will put the projects, the learning notes about any new/old/current topic.
I will gather and refactor old repositories already present in the parent GitHub host server (big cleaning process) therefore there will be several subdirectories.
Important note: Some bits of code will be hidden because some source code from books need to be bought i.e. if you want the code you need to buy the book and contact the author.
