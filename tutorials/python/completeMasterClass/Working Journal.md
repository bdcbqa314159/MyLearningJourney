Here I am going to develop about the path of learning.

- We start with the installation and how we do the work to get the software working on the command prompt and with some simple .py files. Nothing very difficult there because I am not a newbie on that matter.

- We alsotalk about variables, we see the concept of a variable outside the programming language and then we see how they are set within python. Again nothing very difficult.

- We introduce int, float and str types, we talk about methods within the str datatype.

- We talk about casting i.e. how modify the original type of a variable, we also see how some methods modify the value only by copy and no the inner instance of the variable.

- We work with operators: mathematical ones, assignement operators and comparison ones.

- We talk about data collections: list collection, tuple collection, set collection and dictionary collection. For all of them we show how we use them from simple construction to interaction with their methods. We also show how we can use the dir method.

- We talk about the built-in IDLE of python software.

- We talk about the modules which are included within python software. We showed how to use the dir method, the help method an the alias to rename an imported module.

- We talk about conditional flow: if, elif, ..., else. The usage of 'and' and 'or' within this logic flow. The usage of loops: while and for. Finally we see the usage of 'break' and 'continue' keywords.

- We did our first project, quite simple but fun.

- We talk about how to interact with files and then we did our second project about interaction with the csv files and some filtering applications.

- We talk about the os module, very important one.

- We talk about functions and how to use them.

- We introduce the notion of class within python, we also worked with the inheritance concept.

- We talked about error handling and how we do manage the exceptions.

- We talked about formatting strings - the method is not my preferred one as I mostly use the format method or the f"" declaration.
